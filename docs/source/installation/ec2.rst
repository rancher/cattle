Information
***********

This CloudFormation template will create a single EC2 instance that has Cattle installed and it will register itself as a Docker server.  Once the installation is done, which could take 20 minutes, the UI and API will be accessible at http://ec2-XX-XXX-XXX-XX.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/v1.


Logging in
**********

You can log into the server by running ssh similar to below

``ssh -l ubuntu -i mykey.pem ec2-XX-XXX-XXX-XX.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com``

The installation log is at :file:`/var/log/cattle-install.log`.  If everything ran successfully you should be able to run ``cattle list-host`` and see one host registered.
